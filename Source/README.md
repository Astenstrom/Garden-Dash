Gameboy game coded in C

This game was created for CS 2261 at The Georgia Institute of Technology. The game is coded in C. Some art was created by me and some was adapted from Harest Moon. Art was editied in Usenti and the music was edited using Audacity. 

All you need to do to play this game is download an emulator, such as Visual Boy Advance, and the .gba file from here. Run the gba file in the emulator and further instructions will be provided.
